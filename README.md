# EfficientNet-Pytorch

A PyTorch implementation of EfficientNet-B0

Unfortunately, I have no time to train the model on my PC, if you're interested in it, you can try to run `train.py`.

If you don't have time just like me, you can move to https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch to use pretrained EfficientNet model.
